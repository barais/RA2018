\begin{module}{presentation}{overall}{Overall objectives}

  \team{}'s research agenda targets core values of software engineering. 
  In this fundamental domain we focus and develop models, methodologies and theories to address major challenges raised by the emergence of several forms of diversity in the design, deployment and evolution of software-intensive systems.
  Software diversity has emerged as an essential phenomenon in all application domains born by our industrial partners. These application domains range from complex systems brought by systems of systems (addressed in collaboration with Thales and DGA) and Instrumentation and Control (addressed with EDF) to pervasive combinations of Internet of Things and Internet of Services (addressed with TellU and Software AG) and tactical information systems (addressed in collaboration with civil  security).
  Today these systems seem to be radically different, but we envision a strong convergence  of the scientific principles that underpin their construction and validation, bringing forwards sane and reliable methods for the design of  \textbf{flexible and open yet dependable systems}. 
  Flexibility and openness are critical and challenging software layer properties that must deal with four dimensions of diversity: \textbf{diversity of languages}, used by the stakeholders involved in the construction of these systems;  \textbf{diversity of features}, required by the different customers; \textbf{diversity of runtime environments}, in which software has to run and adapt; \textbf{diversity of implementations}, which are necessary for resilience by redundancy.

  In this context, the central software engineering challenge consists in handling \textbf{diversity} from variability in requirements and design to heterogeneous and dynamic execution environments. 
  In particular this requires considering that the software system must adapt, in unpredictable ways, to changes in the requirements and environment. 
  Conversely, explicitly handling of diversity is a great opportunity to allow software to spontaneously explore alternative design solutions. 
  Concretely, we want to provide software engineers with the ability:
  \begin{itemize}
      \item to characterize an `envelope' of possible variations
      \item to compose `envelopes' (to discover new macro envelopes in an opportunistic manner)
      \item to dynamically synthesize software inside a given  envelop
  \end{itemize}

  The major scientific objective that we must achieve to provide such mechanisms for software engineering is synthesized below


    \textbf{Scientific objective for \team{}:} Automatically \textbf{compose and synthesize software diversity} from design to runtime to \textbf{address unpredictable evolutions of software-intensive systems} 

  Software product lines and associated variability modeling formalisms represent an essential aspect of software diversity, which we already explored in the past and that represent a major foundation of \team{}'s research agenda. 
  However, \team{}  also exploits other foundations to handle new forms of diversity: type theory and models of computation for the composition of languages; distributed algorithms and pervasive computation to handle the diversity of execution platforms;  functional and qualitative randomized transformations to synthesize diversity for robust systems.

\label{sec:sota}

\subsection{Model-driven engineering}    

Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) aims at reducing the accidental complexity associated with developing complex software-intensive systems (e.g., use of abstractions of the problem space rather than abstractions of the solution space)  \footcite{Schmidt06}. It provides \team{} with solid foundations to specify, analyze and reason about the different forms of diversity that occur through the development lifecycle. A primary source of accidental complexity is the wide gap between the concepts used by domain experts and the low-level abstractions provided by general-purpose programming languages~\footcite{France07}. MDE approaches address this problem through  modeling techniques that support separation of concerns and automated generation of major system artifacts from models (\emph{e.g.,} test cases, implementations, deployment and configuration scripts). In MDE, a model describes an aspect of a system and is typically created or derived for specific development purposes~\footcite{BAN04}. Separation of concerns is supported through the use of different modeling languages, each providing constructs based on abstractions that are specific to an aspect of a system. MDE technologies also provide support for manipulating models, for example, support for querying, slicing, transforming, merging, and analyzing (including executing) models. Modeling languages are thus at the core of MDE, which participates to the development of a sound \emph{Software Language Engineering}~\footnote{See \url{http://planet-sl.org}}, including an unified typing theory that integrate models as first class entities~\footcite{Steel07a}. 

Incorporating domain-specific concepts and high-quality development experience into MDE technologies can significantly improve developer productivity and system quality. Since the late nineties, this realization has led to work on MDE language workbenches that support the development of domain-specific modeling languages (DSMLs) and associated tools (\emph{e.g.,} model editors and code generators). A DSML provides a bridge between the field in which domain experts work and the implementation (programming) field. Domains in which DSMLs have been developed and used include, among others, automotive, avionics, and the emerging cyber-physical systems. A study performed by Hutchinson et al.   \footcite{Hutchinson11} provides some indications that DSMLs can pave the way for wider industrial adoption of MDE.

More recently, the emergence of new classes of systems that are complex and  operate in heterogeneous and rapidly changing environments raises new challenges for the software engineering community. These systems must be adaptable, flexible, reconfigurable and, increasingly, self-managing. Such characteristics make systems more prone to failure when running and thus the development and study of appropriate mechanisms for continuous design and run-time validation and monitoring are needed. In the MDE community, research is focused primarily on using models at design, implementation, and deployment stages of development. This work has been highly productive, with several techniques now entering a commercialization phase. As software systems are becoming more and more dynamic, the use of model-driven techniques for validating and monitoring run-time behavior
is extremely promising   \footcite{Morin09f}.



\subsection{Variability modeling}
\label{sec:variability}
% TODO: too many citations
While the basic vision underlying \textit{Software Product Lines} (SPL) can
probably be traced back to David Parnas seminal article~  \footcite{parnas1976} on
the Design and Development of Program Families, it is only quite recently that
SPLs are emerging as a paradigm shift towards modeling and developing
software system families rather than individual
systems~\footcite{Northrop1999}. SPL engineering embraces the ideas of mass
customization and software reuse. It focuses on the means of efficiently
producing and maintaining multiple related software products, exploiting what
they have in common and managing what varies among them.

Several definitions of the \emph{software product line} concept can be found
in the research literature. Clements \textit{et~al.} define it as \textit{a set of
software-intensive systems sharing a common, managed set of features that
satisfy the specific needs of a particular market segment or mission and are
developed from a common set of core assets in a prescribed way}
  \footcite{Northrop2002}. Bosch provides a different definition   \footcite{Bosch2000}:
\textit{A SPL consists of a product line architecture and a set of reusable
components designed for incorporation into the product line architecture. In
addition, the PL consists of the software products developed using the
mentioned reusable assets}. In spite of the similarities, these definitions
provide different perspectives of the concept: \textit{market-driven}, as seen
by Clements \textit{et~al.}, and \textit{technology-oriented} for Bosch.

SPL engineering is a process focusing on capturing the \textit{commonalities}
(assumptions true for each family member) and \textit{variability}
(assumptions about how individual family members differ) between several
software products   \footcite{Coplien1998}. Instead of describing a single software
system, a SPL model describes a set of products in the same domain. This is
accomplished by distinguishing between elements common to all SPL members, and
those that may vary from one product to another. Reuse of core assets, which
form the basis of the product line, is key to productivity and quality
gains. These core assets extend beyond simple code reuse and may include the
architecture, software components, domain models, requirements statements,
documentation, test plans or test cases.


The SPL engineering process consists of two major steps:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Domain Engineering}, or \emph{development for reuse}, focuses on
core assets development.
\item \textbf{Application Engineering}, or \emph{development with reuse},
addresses the development of the final products using core assets and
following customer requirements.
\end{enumerate}

Central to both processes is the management of \textbf{variability} across
the product line~  \footcite{halmans2003}. In common language use, the term
\textit{variability} refers to \textit{the ability or the tendency to
change}. Variability management is thus seen as the key feature that
distinguishes SPL engineering from other software development approaches
  \footcite{Bosch2002}. Variability management is thus growingly seen as the
cornerstone of SPL development, covering the entire development life cycle,
from requirements elicitation~  \footcite{Jean-ChristopheTRIGAUX2003} to product
derivation~  \footcite{Ziadi2006a} to product testing~  \footcite{nebut03b,Nebut06b}. 
 

Halmans \textit{et~al.}   \footcite{halmans2003} distinguish between \textit{essential} and
\textit{technical} variability, especially at requirements level. Essential
variability corresponds to the customer's viewpoint, defining what to
implement, while technical variability relates to product family engineering,
defining how to implement it. A classification based on the dimensions of
variability is proposed by Pohl \textit{et~al.}   \footcite{Pohl2005}: beyond
\textbf{variability in time} (existence of different versions of an artifact
that are valid at different times) and \textbf{variability in space}
(existence of an artifact in different shapes at the same time) Pohl \textit{et~al.} claim that variability is important to different stakeholders and thus has
different levels of visibility: \textbf{external variability} is visible to
the customers while \textbf{internal variability}, that of domain artifacts,
is hidden from them. Other classification proposals come from Meekel \textit{et~al.}   \footcite{Meekel1998} (feature, hardware platform, performances and attributes
variability) or Bass \textit{et~al.}   \footcite{Bachmann2001} who discuss about variability
at the architectural level.


Central to the modeling of variability is the notion of \textit{feature},
originally defined by Kang \textit{et~al.} as: \textit{a prominent or distinctive user-visible
aspect, quality or characteristic of a software system or
systems}~  \footcite{Kang1990}. Based on this notion of \textit{feature}, they proposed to use a
\textit{feature model} to model the variability in a SPL. A
feature model consists of a \textit{feature diagram} and other associated
information: \textit{constraints} and \textit{dependency rules}. Feature
diagrams provide a \textit{graphical tree-like notation depicting the
hierarchical organization of high level product functionalities} represented
as features. The root of the tree refers to the complete system and is
progressively decomposed into more refined features (tree nodes). Relations
between nodes (features) are materialized by \textit{decomposition edges} and
\textit{textual constraints}. Variability can be expressed in several
ways. Presence or absence of a feature from a product is modeled using
\textit{mandatory} or \textit{optional features}. Features are graphically
represented as rectangles while some graphical elements (e.g., unfilled
circle) are used to describe the variability (e.g., a feature may be
optional).

Features can be organized into \textit{feature groups}. Boolean operators
\textit{exclusive alternative (XOR)}, \textit{inclusive alternative (OR)} or
\textit{inclusive (AND)} are used to select one, several or all the features
from a feature group. Dependencies between features can be modeled using
\textit{textual constraints}: \textit{requires} (presence of a feature requires
the presence of another), \textit{mutex} (presence of a feature automatically
excludes another). Feature attributes can be also used for modeling quantitative (e.g., numerical) information. 
Constraints over attributes and features can be specified as well. 

Modeling variability allows an organization to capture and select which
version of which variant of any particular aspect is wanted in the
system~  \footcite{Bosch2002}. To implement it cheaply, quickly and safely, redoing by hand
the tedious weaving of every aspect is not an option: some form of automation
is needed to leverage the modeling of
variability~  \footcite{batory2002,czarnecki2000}. Model Driven Engineering (MDE)
makes it possible to automate this weaving process~  \footcite{Jezequel08a}. This
requires that models are no longer informal, and that the weaving process is
itself described as a program (which is as a matter of facts an executable
meta-model~  \footcite{Muller05a}) manipulating these models to produce for instance a
detailed design that can ultimately be transformed to code, or to test
suites~\footcite{Pickin07a}, or other software artifacts.


\subsection{Component-based software development}

Component-based software development   \footcite{szyperski2002component} aims at providing reliable software architectures with a low cost of design.
Components are now used routinely in many domains of software system designs: 
distributed systems, user interaction, product lines, embedded systems, etc.
With respect to more traditional software artifacts (e.g., object oriented architectures),
modern component models have the following distinctive features~  \footcite{crnkovic2011classification}: 
description of requirements on services required from the other components;
indirect connections between components thanks to ports and connectors constructs~  \footcite{lau2005exogenous};
hierarchical definition of components (assemblies of components can define new component types);
connectors supporting various communication semantics~  \footcite{bures2006sofa};
quantitative properties on the services~  \footcite{beugnard2010contract}.

In recent years  component-based architectures have evolved from static designs to dynamic, adaptive designs (e.g., SOFA~  \footcite{bures2006sofa}, Palladio~  \footcite{Becker:2009cl}, Frascati~  \footcite{Melisson:2010it}).
Processes for building a system using a statically designed architecture are made of  the following sequential lifecycle stages: requirements, modeling, implementation, packaging, deployment, system launch, system execution, system shutdown and system removal.
If for any reason after design time architectural changes are needed after system launch (e.g., because requirements changed, or the implementation platform has evolved, etc) then the design process must be reexecuted from scratch 
(unless the changes are limited to parameter adjustment in the components deployed).

Dynamic designs allow for \textit{on the fly} redesign of a component based system. 
A  process for dynamic adaptation is able to reapply the  design phases while the system is up and running, without stopping it (this is different from stop/redeploy/start).
This kind of process supports \textit{chosen adaptation}, when changes are planned and realized to maintain a good fit between the needs that the system must support and the way it supports them~  \footcite{Kramer:2007kv}.
Dynamic component-based designs rely on a component meta-model that supports complex life cycles for components, connectors, service specification, etc.
Advanced dynamic designs can also take platform changes into account at run-time, without human intervention, by adapting themselves~  \footcite{Cheng:2009hh,Vromant:NPd9bKZ}.
Platform changes and more generally environmental changes trigger \textit{imposed adaptation}, when the system can no longer use its design to provide the services it must support.
In order to support an eternal system~  \footcite{Bencomo:2009tm}, dynamic component based systems must separate architectural design and platform compatibility.
This requires  support for heterogeneity, since platform evolutions can be partial.

The Models@runtime paradigm denotes a model-driven approach aiming at taming the complexity of dynamic software systems. It basically pushes the idea of reflection one step further by considering the reflection layer as a real model ``something simpler, safer or cheaper than reality to avoid the complexity, danger and irreversibility of reality  \footcite{Rothenberg89thenature}''. In practice, component-based (and/or service-based) platforms offer reflection APIs that make it possible to introspect the system (which components and bindings are currently in place in the system) and dynamic adaptation (by applying CRUD operations on these components and bindings). While some of these platforms offer rollback mechanisms to recover after an erroneous adaptation, the idea of Models@runtime is to prevent the system from actually enacting an erroneous adaptation. In other words, the ``model at run-time'' is a reflection model that can be uncoupled (for reasoning, validation, simulation purposes) and automatically resynchronized.



Heterogeneity is a key challenge for modern component based system. 
Until recently, component based techniques were designed to address a specific domain, such as embedded software for command and control, or distributed Web based service oriented architectures.
The emergence of the Internet of Things paradigm calls for a unified approach in component based design techniques.
By implementing an efficient separation of concern between platform independent architecture management and platform dependent implementations,
\textit{Models@runtime}  is now established as a key technique to support dynamic  component based designs. It provides \team{} with an essential foundation to explore an adaptation envelop at run-time. 

Search Based Software Engineering   \footcite{harman2001search} has been applied to various software engineering problems in order to support software developers in their daily work.
The goal is to automatically  explore a set of alternatives and assess their relevance with respect to the considered problem. 
These techniques have been applied to craft software architecture exhibiting high quality of services properties   \footcite{frey2013search}. 
Multi  Objectives Search based techniques   \footcite{deb2002fast} deal with optimization problem containing several (possibly conflicting) dimensions to optimize. 
These techniques provide \team{} with the scientific foundations for reasoning and efficiently exploring an envelope of software configurations at run-time.
 


\subsection{Validation and verification}

Validation and verification (V\&V) theories and techniques provide the means to assess the validity of a software system with respect to a specific correctness envelop. As such, they form an essential element of \team{}'s scientific background. In particular, we focus on model-based V\&V in order to leverage the different models that specify the envelop at different moments of the software development lifecycle.

%MBT
Model-based testing consists in analyzing a formal model of a system (\textit{e.g.}, activity diagrams, which capture high-level requirements about the system, statecharts, which capture the expected behavior of a software module, or a feature model, which describes all possible variants of the system) in order to generate test cases that will be executed against the system. Model-based testing   \footcite{utting2010practical} mainly relies on model analysis, constraint solving   \footcite{demilli1991constraint} and search-based reasoning   \footcite{mcminn2004search}. \team{} leverages in particular the applications of model-based testing in the context of highly-configurable systems and    \footcite{yilmaz2006covering} interactive systems   \footcite{memon2007event} as well as recent advances based on diversity for test cases selection   \footcite{HemmatiBAA10}.



%simulation

Nowadays, it is possible to simulate various kinds of models. Existing tools range from industrial tools such as Simulink, Rhapsody or Telelogic to academic approaches like Omega   \footcite{ober2006validating}, or Xholon   \footnote{http://www.primordion.com/Xholon/}.  %or the Turtle toolkit   \footcite{apvrille2004turtle}. 
All these simulation environments operate on  homogeneous environment models. However, to handle diversity in software systems, we also leverage recent advances in heterogeneous simulation. 
Ptolemy   \footcite{buck1994ptolemy} proposes a common abstract syntax, which represents
the description of the model structure. These elements can be decorated using different
directors that reflect the application of a specific model of computation on the model element. 
Metropolis  \footcite{balarin2003metropolis} provides modeling elements amenable to semantically
equivalent mathematical models. Metropolis offers a precise semantics flexible enough to
support different models of computation.
ModHel'X   \footcite{hardebolle2008modhel} studies the composition of multi-paradigm models relying on
different models of computation. 


%diversity

Model-based testing and simulation are complemented by runtime fault-tolerance through the automatic generation of software variants that can run in parallel, to tackle the open nature of software-intensive systems. The foundations in this case are  the seminal work about N-version programming   \footcite{avizienis85}, recovery blocks   \footcite{randell75} and code randomization   \footcite{barrantes05}, which demonstrated the central role of diversity in software to ensure runtime resilience of complex systems. Such techniques rely on truly diverse software solutions in order to provide systems with the ability to react to events, which could not be predicted at design time and checked through testing or simulation. 


\subsection{Empirical software engineering}

The rigorous, scientific evaluation of \team{}'s contributions is an essential aspect of our research methodology. In addition to theoretical validation through formal analysis or complexity estimation, we also aim at applying state-of-the-art methodologies and principles of empirical software engineering. This approach encompasses a set of techniques for the sound validation contributions in the field of software engineering, ranging from statistically sound comparisons of techniques and large-scale data analysis to interviews and systematic literature reviews   \footcite{shull2008guide, runeson2009guidelines}. Such methods have been used for example to understand the impact of new software development paradigms   \footcite{briand1999empirical}. Experimental design and statistical tests represent another major aspect of empirical software engineering.  Addressing large-scale software engineering problems often requires the application of heuristics, and it is important to understand their effects through sound statistical analyses   \footcite{ArcuriB11}.

\begin{module}{fondements}{axis}{Research axis}
\label{sec:axis}

Figure \ref{fig:axis} illustrates the four dimensions of software diversity, which form the core research axis of \team{}: the \textbf{diversity of languages} used by the stakeholders involved in the construction of these systems; the \textbf{diversity of features} required by the different customers; the \textbf{diversity of runtime environments} in which software has to run and adapt; the \textbf{diversity of implementations} that are necessary for resilience through redundancy. 
These four axis share and leverage the scientific and technological results developed in the area of model-driven engineering in the last decade. 
This means that all our research activities are founded on sound abstractions to reason about specific aspects of software systems, compose different perspectives and automatically generate parts of the system.

\subsection{Software Language Engineering}
\label{sec:axis-sle}

The engineering of systems involves many different stakeholders, each with their own domain of expertise. Hence more and more organizations are adopting Domain Specific Modeling Languages (DSMLs) to allow domain experts to express solutions directly in terms of relevant domain concepts   \footcite{Schmidt06,France07}. This new trend raises new challenges about designing DSMLs, evolving a set of DSMLs and coordinating the use of multiple DSLs for both DSL designers and DSL users.


\subsubsection*{Challenges} 

\textbf{Reusability} of software artifacts is a central notion that has been thoroughly studied and used by both academics and industrials since the early days of software construction. Essentially, designing reusable artifacts allows the construction of large systems from smaller parts that have been separately developed and validated, thus reducing the development costs by capitalizing on previous engineering efforts.
%
However, it is still hardly possible for language designers to design typical language artifacts (e.g. language constructs, grammars, editors or compilers) in a reusable way. The current state of the practice usually prevents the reusability of language artifacts from one language to another, consequently hindering the emergence of real engineering techniques around software languages.
Conversely, concepts and mechanisms that enable artifacts reusability abound in the software engineering community. 

\textbf{Variability} in modeling languages occur in the definition of the abstract and concrete syntax as well as in the specification of the language's semantics. 
The major challenges met when addressing the need for variability are: (i)~set principles for modeling language units that support the modular specification of a modeling language; and (ii)~design mechanisms to assemble these units in a complete language, according to the set of authorized variation points for the modeling language family.


A new generation of complex software-intensive systems (for example smart health support, smart grid, building energy management, and intelligent transportation systems) presents new opportunities for leveraging modeling languages. The development of these systems requires expertise in diverse domains.
Consequently, different types of stakeholders (e.g., scientists, engineers and end-users) must work in a coordinated manner on various aspects of the system across multiple development phases. DSMLs can be used to support the work of domain experts who focus on a specific system aspect, but they can also provide the means for coordinating work across teams specializing in different aspects and across development phases. The support and integration of DSMLs leads to what we call \textbf{the globalization of modeling languages}, \textit{i.e.} the use of multiple languages for the coordinated development of diverse aspects of a system. One can make an analogy with world globalization in which relationships are established between sovereign countries to regulate interactions (e.g., travel and commerce related interactions) while preserving each country's independent existence.


\subsubsection*{Scientific objectives} 

We address reuse and variability challenges through the investigation of the time-honored concepts of substitutability, inheritance and components, evaluate their relevance for language designers and provide tools and methods for their inclusion in software language engineering.
We will develop novel techniques for the modular construction of language extensions with the support of model syntactical variability. From the semantics perspective, we investigate extension mechanisms for the specification of variability in  operational semantics, focusing on static introduction and heterogeneous models of computation. The definition of variation points for the three aspects of the language definition provides the foundations for the novel concept Language Unit (LU) as well as suitable mechanisms to compose such units.


We explore the necessary breakthrough in software languages to support modeling and simulation of heterogeneous and open systems. This work relies on the specification of executable domain specific modeling languages (DSMLs) to formalize the various concerns of a software-intensive system, and of models of computation (MoCs) to explicitly model the concurrency, time and communication of such DSMLs. We develop a framework that integrates the necessary foundations and facilities for designing and
implementing executable and concurrent domain-specific modeling languages. It also provides unique features to specify composition operators between (possibly heterogeneous) DSMLs. Such specifications are amenable to support the edition, execution, graphical animation and analysis of heterogeneous models. The objective is to provide both a significant improvement of MoCs and DSMLs design and implementation; and the simulation based validation and verification of complex systems.


We see an opportunity for the automatic diversification of programs' computation semantics, for example through the diversification of compilers or virtual machines. The main impact of this artificial diversity is to provide flexible computation and thus ease adaptation to different execution conditions. A combination of static and dynamic analysis could support the identification of what we call \emph{plastic computation zones} in the code. We identify different categories of such zones: (i)~areas in the code in which the
order of computation can vary (e.g., the order in which a block of sequential statements is executed); (ii)~areas that can be removed, keeping the essential functionality   \footcite{Sidiroglou-Douskos2011} (e.g., skip some loop iterations); (iii)~areas that can replaced by alternative code (e.g., replace a try-catch by a return statement). Once we know which zones in the code can be randomized, it is necessary to modify the model of computation to leverage the computation plasticity. This consists in introducing variation points in the interpreter
to reflect the diversity of models of computation. Then, the choice of a given variation is performed randomly at run-time.



\subsection{Variability Modeling and Engineering}
\label{sec:axis-spl}

The systematic modeling of variability in software systems has emerged as an effective approach to document and reason about software evolutions and heterogeneity (\textit{cf.} Section~\ref{sec:variability}). Variability modeling characterizes an ``envelope'' of possible software variations. The industrial use of variability models and their relation to software artifact models require a complete engineering framework, including composition, decomposition, analysis, configuration and artifact derivation, refactoring, re-engineering, extraction, and testing.  This framework can be used both to tame imposed diversity and to manage chosen diversity.  



\subsubsection*{Challenges} 

A fundamental problem is that the \textbf{number of variants} can be exponential in the number of options (features). 
Already with 300~boolean configuration options, approximately $10^{90}$ configurations exist -- more than estimated count of atoms in the universe. Domains like automotive or operating systems have to manage more than 10000 options (e.g., Linux). Practitioners face the challenge of developing billions of variants. It is easy to forget a necessary constraint, leading to the synthesis of unsafe variants, or to under-approximate the capabilities of the software platform. Scalable modelling techniques are therefore crucial to specify and reason about a very large set of variants.

Model-driven development supports two ways to deal with the increasing number of concerns in complex systems: multi-view modeling, \textit{i.e.} when modeling each concern separately, and variability modeling. However, there is little support to combine both approaches consistently. Techniques to integrate both approaches will enable the construction of a consistent set of views and variation points in each view.

The design, construction and maintenance of software families have a major impact on \textbf{software testing}. Among the existing challenges, we can cite: the selection of test cases for a specific variant; the evolution of test suites with integration of new variants; the combinatorial explosion of the number of software configurations to be tested. Novel model-based techniques for test generation and test management in a software product line context are needed to overcome state-of-the-art limits we already observed in some projects.

\subsubsection*{Scientific objectives} 


We aim at developing scalable reasoning techniques to \textbf{automatically analyze} variability models and their interactions with other views on the software intensive system (requirements, architecture, design, code). These techniques  provide two major advancements in the  state of the art: (1)~an extension of the semantics of variability models in order to enable the definition of attributes (\textit{e.g.}, cost, quality of service, effort) on features and to include these attributes in the reasoning;  (2)~an assessment of the consistent specification of variability models with respect to system views (since variability is orthogonal to system modeling, it is currently possible to specify the different models in ways that are semantically meaningless). The former aspect of analysis is tackled through  constraint solving and finite-domain constraint programming, while the latter aspect is investigated through automatic search-based and learning-based techniques for the exploration of the space of interaction between variability and view models.

%Manual elaboration of variability models (e.g., feature models) is not realistic for large projects or for legacy systems. 
We want to develop procedures to \textbf{reverse engineer} dependencies and features' sets from existing software artefacts -- be it source code, configuration files, spreadsheets (e.g., product comparison matrices) or requirements. 
We expect to scale up (e.g., for extracting a very large number of variation points) and guarantee some properties (e.g., soundness of configuration semantics, understandability of ontological semantics). 
For instance, when building complex software-intensive systems, textual requirements are captured in very large quantities of documents. In this context, adequate models to formalize the organization of requirements documents and automated techniques to support impact analysis (in case of changes in the requirements) have to be developed.

% We also aim at developing sound methods and tools to integrate variability management in model-based testing activities. In particular, we will leverage requirement models as an essential asset to establish formal relations between variation points and test models. These relations will form the basis for novel algorithms that drive  the systematic selection of test configurations that satisfy well-defined test adequacy criteria as well as the generation of test cases for a specific product in the product line.




\subsection{Heterogeneous and dynamic software architectures}
\label{sec:axis-runtime}



Flexible yet dependable systems have to cope with heterogeneous hardware execution platforms ranging from smart sensors to huge computation infrastructures and data centers. Evolutions range from a mere change in the system configuration to a major architectural redesign,  for instance to support addition of new features or a change in the platform architecture (new hardware is made available, a running system switches to low bandwidth wireless communication, a computation node battery is running low, etc).
In this context, we need to devise formalisms to reason about the impact of an evolution and about the transition from one configuration to another.
It must be noted that this axis focuses on the use of models to drive the evolution from design time to run-time. 
Models will be used to (i)~systematically define predictable configurations and variation points through which the system will evolve;
(ii)~develop behaviors necessary to handle unpredicted evolutions.
%In the coming years, we will initiate research in this axis in the following directions.

\subsubsection*{Challenges} 

The main challenge is to provide new homogeneous architectural modelling languages and efficient techniques that enable continuous software reconfiguration to react to changes. This work handles the challenges of handling the diversity of runtime infrastructures and managing the cooperation between different stakeholders. More specifically, the research developed in this axis targets the following dimensions of software diversity.

%\textbf{Imposed diversity}

Platform architectural heterogeneity induces a first dimension of imposed diversity (type diversity). Platform reconfigurations driven by changing resources define another dimension of diversity (deployment diversity). To deal with these imposed diversity problems, we will  rely on  model based runtime support for adaptation, in the spirit of the dynamic distributed component framework developed by the Triskell team. Since the runtime environment composed of distributed, resource constrained hardware nodes cannot afford the overhead of traditional runtime adaptation techniques, we investigate the design of novel solutions relying on models@runtime and on specialized tiny virtual machines to offer resource provisioning and dynamic reconfigurations. In the next two years this research will be supported by the InfraJVM project.

%\textbf{Chosen diversity}

Diversity can also be an asset to optimize software architecture. Architecture models must integrate multiple concerns in order to properly manage the deployment of software components over a physical platform. However, these concerns can contradict each other (\textit{e.g.}, accuracy and energy). In this context, we investigate automatic solutions to explore the set of possible architecture models and to establish valid trade-offs between all concerns in case of changes. 


%projects

\subsubsection*{Scientific objectives} 

 
\textbf{Automatic synthesis of optimal software architectures.} Implementing a service over a distributed platform (\textit{e.g.}, a pervasive system or a cloud platform) consists in deploying multiple software components over distributed computation nodes. We aim at designing search-based solutions to (i)~assist the software architect in establishing a good initial architecture (that balances between different factors such as cost of the nodes, latency, fault tolerance) and to automatically update the architecture when the environment or the system itself change. The choice of search-based techniques is motivated by the very large number of possible software deployment architectures that can be investigated and that all provide different trade-offs between qualitative factors. Another essential aspect that is supported by multi-objective search is to explore different architectural solutions that are not necessarily comparable. This is important when the qualitative factors are orthogonal to each other, such as security and usability for example.

\textbf{Flexible software architecture for testing and data management.} As the number of  platforms on which software runs increases and different software versions coexist, the demand for testing environments also increases. For example, to test a  software patch or upgrade, the number of testing environments  is the product of the number of running environments the  software supports and the number of coexisting versions of the  software.  
Based on our first experiment on the synthesis of cloud environment using architectural models, our objective is to define a set of domain specific languages to catch the requirement and to design cloud environments for testing and data management of future internet systems from data centers to things. These languages will be interpreted to support dynamic synthesis and reconfiguration of a testing environment.

\textbf{Runtime support for heterogeneous environments.}
Execution environments must provide a way to account or reserve resources for applications. However, current execution environments such as the Java Virtual Machine do not clearly define a notion of application: each framework has its own definition. 
For example, in OSGi, an application is a component, in JEE, an application is most of the time associated to a class loader, in the Multi-Tasking Virtual machine, an application is a process. 
The challenge consists in defining an execution environment that provides direct control over resources (CPU, Memory, Network I/O) independently from the definition of an application. 
We propose to define abstract resource containers to account and reserve resources on a distributed network of heterogeneous devices.

\subsection{Diverse implementations for resilience}
\label{sec:axis-implementation}

Open software-intensive systems have to evolve over their lifetime in response to changes in their environment. Yet, most verification techniques assume a closed environment or the ability to predict all changes. Dynamic changes and evolutions thus represent a major challenge for these techniques that aim at assessing the correctness and robustness of the system. On the one hand, \team{} will adapt V\&V techniques to handle diversity imposed by the requirements and the execution environment, on the other hand we leverage diversity to increase the robustness of software in face of unpredicted situations. More specifically, we address the following V\&V challenges.

\subsubsection*{Challenges} 

%\textbf{Imposed diversity}

One major challenge to build flexible and open yet dependable systems is that current software engineering techniques require architects to foresee all possible  situations the system will have to face. However, openness and flexibility also mean unpredictability: unpredictable bugs, attacks, environmental evolutions, etc. Current fault-tolerance   \footcite{randell75} and security   \footcite{forrest1997building} techniques  provide software systems with the capacity of detecting   accidental and deliberate faults. However, existing solutions assume that the set of bugs or vulnerabilities in a system does not evolve. This assumption does not hold for open systems, thus it is essential to revisit fault-tolerance and security solutions to account for diverse and unpredictable faults.

%\textbf{Chosen diversity}

Diversity is known to be a major asset for the robustness of large, open, and complex systems (\textit{e.g.}, economical or ecological systems). 
Following this observation, the software engineering literature provides a rich set of work that choose to implement diversity in software systems in order to improve robustness to attacks or to changes in quality of service. 
These works range from N-version programming to obfuscation of data structures or control flow, to randomization of instruction sets. 
An essential remaining challenge is to support the automatic synthesis and evolution of software diversity in open software-intensive systems.
There is an opportunity to further enhance these techniques in order to cope with a wider diversity of faults, by multiplying the levels of diversity in the different software layers that are found in software-intensive systems (system, libraries, frameworks, application). 
This increased diversity must be based on artificial program transformations and code synthesis, which increase the chances of exploring novel solutions, better fitted at one point in time. The biological analogy also indicates that diversity should emerge as a side-effect of evolution, to prevent over-specialization towards one kind of diversity.


\subsubsection*{Scientific objectives} 

The main objective is to address one of the main limitations of N-version programming for fault-tolerant systems: the manual production and management of software diversity. Through automated injection of artificial diversity we aim at systematically increasing failure diversity and thus increasing the chances of early error detection at run-time. A fundamental assumption for this work is that software-intensive systems can be ``good enough''   \footcite{Rinard12, Zhu12}. 

\textbf{Proactive program diversification.} We aim at establishing novel principles and techniques that favor the emergence of multiple forms of software diversity in software-intensive systems, in conjunction with the software adaptation mechanisms that leverage this diversity. The main expected outcome is a set of meta-design principles that maintain diversity in systems and the experimental demonstration of the effects of software diversity on the
adaptive capacities of CASs. Higher levels of diversity in the system provide a pool of software solutions that can eventually be used to adapt to  situations unforeseen at design time (bugs, crash, attacks, etc.). Principles of automated software diversification rely on the automated synthesis of variants in a software product line, as well as finer-grained program synthesis combining unsound transformations and genetic programming to explore the space of mutational robustness.

\textbf{Multi-tier software diversification.} We call  multi-tier diversification the fact of diversifying several application software components simultaneously. The novelty of our proposal, with respect to the software diversity state of the art, is to diversify the application-level code (for example, diversify the business logics of the application), focusing on the technical layers found in web applications. 
The diversification of application software code is expected to provide a diversity of failures and vulnerabilities in web server deployment. 
Web server deployment usually adopts a form of the Reactor architecture pattern, for scalability purposes: multiple copies of the server software stack, called request handlers, are deployed behind a load balancer. 
This architecture is very favorable for diversification, since by using the multiplicity of request handlers running in a web server we can simultaneously deploy multiple combinations of diverse software components. Then, if one handler is hacked or crashes the others should still be able to process client requests.

   \textsc{Keywords:} Software line product - Configurators - Customisation \\ 


    \textsc{Scientific Description:} FAMILIAR (for FeAture Model scrIpt Language for manIpulation and Automatic Reasoning) is a language for importing, exporting, composing, decomposing, editing, configuring, computing "diffs", refactoring, reverse engineering, testing, and reasoning about (multiple) feature models. All these operations can be combined to realize complex variability management tasks. 
A comprehensive environment is proposed as well as integration facilities with the Java ecosystem.\\

 \textsc{Functional Description:}  Familiar is an environment for large-scale product customisation. From a model of product features (options, parameters, etc.), Familiar can automatically generate several million variants. These variants can take many forms: software, a graphical interface, a video sequence or even a manufactured product (3D printing). Familiar is particularly well suited for developing web configurators (for ordering customised products online), for providing online comparison tools and also for engineering any family of embedded or software-based products.\\

- Melange, a tool-supported meta-language to modularly define executable modeling languages with execution functions and data, and to extend (EMF-based) existing modeling languages.
- MoCCML, a tool-supported meta-language dedicated to the specification of a Model of Concurrency and Communication (MoCC) and its mapping to a specific abstract syntax and associated execution functions of a modeling language.
- GEL, a tool-supported meta-language dedicated to the specification of the protocol between the execution functions and the MoCC to support the feedback of the data as well as the callback of other expected execution functions.
- BCOoL, a tool-supported meta-language dedicated to the specification of language coordination patterns to automatically coordinates the execution of, possibly heterogeneous, models.
- Sirius Animator, an extension to the model editor designer Sirius to create graphical animators for executable modeling languages.\\

 \textsc{Functional Description:}  The GEMOC Studio is an eclipse package that contains components supporting the GEMOC methodology for building and composing executable Domain-Specific Modeling Languages (DSMLs). It includes the two workbenches:
    The GEMOC Language Workbench: intended to be used by language designers (aka domain experts), it allows to build and compose new executable DSMLs.
    The GEMOC Modeling Workbench: intended to be used by domain designersto create, execute and coordinate models conforming to executable DSMLs. The different concerns of a DSML, as defined with the tools of the language workbench, are automatically deployed into the modeling workbench. They parametrize a generic execution framework that provide various generic services such as graphical animation, debugging tools, trace and event managers, timeline, etc.\\

 \textit{Kevoree Core} \\ 


   \textsc{Keywords:} M2M - Dynamic components - Iot - Heterogeneity - Smart home - Cloud - Software architecture - Dynamic deployment \\ 


    \textsc{Scientific Description:} Kevoree is an open-source models@runtime platform (http://www.kevoree.org) to properly support the dynamic adaptation of distributed systems. Models@runtime basically pushes the idea of reflection one step further by considering the reflection layer as a real model that can be uncoupled from the running architecture (e.g. for reasoning, validation, and simulation purposes) and later automatically resynchronized with its running instance.

Kevoree has been influenced by previous work that we carried out in the DiVA project and the Entimid project. With Kevoree we push our vision of models@runtime farther. In particular, Kevoree provides a proper support for distributed models@runtime. To this aim we introduced the Node concept to model the infrastructure topology and the Group concept to model semantics of inter node communication during synchronization of the reflection model among nodes. Kevoree includes a Channel concept to allow for multiple communication semantics between remoteComponents deployed on heterogeneous nodes. All Kevoree concepts (Component, Channel, Node, Group) obey the object type design pattern to separate deployment artifacts from running artifacts. Kevoree supports multiple kinds of very different execution node technology (e.g. Java, Android, MiniCloud, FreeBSD, Arduino, ...).

Kevoree is distributed under the terms of the LGPL open source license.

 \begin{module}{logiciels}{bil-2731}{Melange}

   \textsc{Keywords:} Model-driven engineering - Meta model - MDE - DSL - Model-driven software engineering - Dedicated langage - Language workbench - Meta-modelisation - Modeling language - Meta-modeling \\ 


    \textsc{Scientific Description:} Melange is a follow-up of the executable metamodeling language Kermeta, which provides a tool-supported dedicated meta-language to safely assemble language modules, customize them and produce new DSMLs. Melange provides specific constructs to assemble together various abstract syntax and operational semantics artifacts into a DSML. DSMLs can then be used as first class entities to be reused, extended, restricted or adapted into other DSMLs. Melange relies on a particular model-oriented type system that provides model polymorphism and language substitutability, i.e. the possibility to manipulate a model through different interfaces and to define generic transformations that can be invoked on models written using different DSLs. Newly produced DSMLs are correct by construction, ready for production (i.e., the result can be deployed and used as-is), and reusable in a new assembly.

Melange is tightly integrated with the Eclipse Modeling Framework ecosystem and relies on the meta-language Ecore for the definition of the abstract syntax of DSLs. Executable meta-modeling is supported by weaving operational semantics defined with Xtend. Designers can thus easily design an interpreter for their DSL in a non-intrusive way. Melange is bundled as a set of Eclipse plug-ins.\\

 \textsc{Functional Description:}  Melange is a language workbench which helps language engineers to mashup their various language concerns as language design choices, to manage their variability, and support their reuse. It provides a modular and reusable approach for customizing, assembling and integrating DSMLs specifications and implementations.\\

 \begin{module}{logiciels}{bil-2580}{Opencompare}

   \textsc{Keyword:} Software Product Line \\ 


   

 \textsc{Functional Description:}  Product comparison matrices (PCMs) are tabular data: supported and unsupported features are documented for both describing the product itself and for discriminating one product compared to another. PCMs abound – we are all using PCMs – and constitute a rich source of knowledge for easily comparing and choosing product. Yet the current practice is suboptimal both for humans and computers, mainly due to unclear semantics, heterogeneous forms of data, and lack of dedicated support. 

OpenCompare.org is an ambitious project for the collaborative edition, the sharing, the standardisation, and the open exploitation of PCMs. The goal of OpenCompare.org is to provide an integrated set of tools (e.g., APIs, visualizations, configurators, editors) for democratizing their creation, import, maintenance, and exploitation.\\

\subsubsection*{ADR Nokia}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Coordinator: Inria
	\item Dates: 2017-2021
	\item Abstract: The goal of this project is to integrate a chaos engineering principles to IoT Services frameworks to improve the robustness of the software-defined network services using this approach and to explore the concept of equivalence for software-defined network services and propose an approach to constantly evolve the attack surface of the network services.
\end{itemize}


\subsubsection*{BCOM}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Coordinator: UR1
	\item Dates: 2018-2024
	\item Abstract: The purpose of the Falcon project is to investigate how to improve the resale of available resources in private clouds to third parties. In this context, the collaboration with DiverSE mainly aims to work on efficient techniques for the design of consumption models and resource consumption forecasting models. These models are then used as a knowledge base in a classical autonomous loop.  
	
	
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{GLOSE}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Partners: Inria/CNRS/Safran
	\item Dates: 2017-2021
	\item Abstract: The GLOSE project develops new techniques for heterogeneous modeling and simulation in the context of systems engineering. It aims to provide formal and operational tools and methods to formalize the behavioral semantics of the various modeling languages used at system-level. These semantics will be used to extract behavioral language interfaces supporting the definition of coordination patterns. These patterns, in turn, can systematically be used to drive the coordination of any model conforming to these languages. The project is structured according to the following tasks: concurrent xDSML engineering, coordination of discrete models, and coordination of discrete/continuous models. The project is funded in the context of the network DESIR, and supported by the GEMOC initiative.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{OneShotSoftware}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Partners: Inria/Orange
	\item Dates: 2017-2019
	\item Abstract: The OSS project investigates an extreme version of moving target defense where a slightly different version of the application is deployed each time it is used (e.g., for crypto functions or payment services). We investigate the analysis, synthesis and transformation techniques to support diversification at 5 points of a software construction pipeline, which, once combined yield up to billions of variants. We also evaluate the support of diversification as a first class property in DevOps.
\end{itemize}


\subsubsection*{Agileo}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Partners: Inria/Agileo
	\item Dates: 2017-2018

\subsubsection*{\label{project:soprano}SOPRANO}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Coordinator: CEA
	\item CEA, University of Paris-Sud, Inria Rennes, OcamlPro, Adacore
	\item Dates: 2014-2018
	\item Abstract:  Today most major verification
    approaches rely on automatic external
    solvers. However these solvers do not fill the current and
    future needs for verification: lack of satisfying model
    generation, lack of reasoning on difficult theories
    (e.g. floating-point arithmetic), lack of extensibility for
    specific or new needs. The SOPRANO 
    project aims at solving these problems and prepare the next generation of verification-oriented
    solvers by gathering experts
    from academia and industry.
     We will design a new framework for the cooperation of
    solvers, focused on model generation and borrowing principles from
    SMT (current standard) and CP (well-known in optimisation).
    These ideas will be implemented in an open-source platform, with regular evaluations
    from the industrial partners.

\subsubsection*{\label{project:varyvary}VaryVary ANR JCJC}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Coordinator: Mathieu Acher
	\item DiverSE, Inria/IRISA Rennes
	\item Dates: 2017-2021
	\item Abstract:  
    Most modern software systems (operating systems like Linux, Web browsers like Firefox or Chrome, video encoders like x264 or ffmpeg, servers, mobile applications, etc.) are subject to variation or come in many variants. Hundreds of configuration options, features, or plugins can be combined, each potentially with distinct functionality and effects on execution time, memory footprint, etc. Among configurations, some of them are chosen and do not compile, crash at runtime, do not pass a test suite, or do not reach a certain performance quality (e.g., energy consumption, security).
In this JCJC ANR project, we follow a thought-provocative and unexplored direction: We consider that the variability boundary of a software system can be specialized and should vary when needs be. The goal of this project is to provide theories, methods and techniques to make vary variability.
Specifically, we consider machine learning and software engineering techniques for narrowing the space of possible configurations to a good approximation of those satisfying the needs of users.
Based on an oracle (e.g., a runtime test) that tells us whether a given configuration meets the requirements (e.g. speed or memory footprint), we leverage machine learning to retrofit the acquired constraints into a variability that can be used to automatically specialize the configurable system. Based on a relative small number of configuration samples, we expect to reach high accuracy for many different kinds of oracles and subject systems.
Our preliminary experiments suggest that varying variability can be practically useful and effective. However, much more work is needed to investigate sampling, testing, and learning techniques within a variety of cases and application scenarios.
We plan to further collect large experimental data and apply our techniques on popular, open-source, configurable software (like Linux, Firefox, ffmpeg, VLC, Apache or JHipster) and generators for media content (like videos, models for 3D printing, or technical papers written in LaTeX).

	\item Coordinator: Universit\'e de Rennes 1
	\item Partners: INRIA, Universit\'e de Rennes 2
	\item Dates: 2016-2019
	\item Abstract:  The PROFILE project brings together experts from law, computer science and sociology to address the challenges raised by online profiling, following a multidisciplinary approach. More precisely, the project will pursue two complementary and mutually informed lines of research: (i) Investigate, design, and introduce a new right of opposition into the legal framework of data protection to better regulate profiling and to modify the behavior of commercial companies towards being more respectful of the privacy of their users; (ii)S Provide users with the technical means they need to detect stealthy profiling techniques as well as to control the extent of the digital traces they routinely produce. As a case study, we focus on browser fingerprinting, a new profiling technique for targeted advertisement. The project will develop a generic framework to reason on the data collected by profiling algorithms, to uncover their inner working, and make them more accountable to users. PROFILE will also propose an innovative protection to mitigate browser fingerprinting, based on the collaborative reconfiguration of browsers.

\subsection{FP7 \& H2020 Projects}

\subsubsection*{\label{project:stamp} H2020 ICT-10-2016 STAMP}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Coordinator: Inria Rennes
	\item Other partners: ATOS, ActiveEon, OW2, TellU, Engineering, XWiki, TU Delft, SINTEF
	\item Dates: 2016-2019
	\item Abstract: Leveraging advanced research in automatic test generation, STAMP aims at pushing automation in DevOps one step further through innovative methods of test amplification. It will reuse existing assets (test cases, API descriptions, dependency models), in order to generate more test cases and test configurations each time the application is updated. Acting at all steps of development cycle, STAMP techniques aim at reducing the number and cost of regression bugs at unit level, configuration level and production stage.
	
	STAMP will raise confidence and foster adoption of DevOps by the European IT industry. The project gathers 3 academic partners with strong software testing expertise, 5 software companies (in: e-Health, Content Management, Smart Cities and Public Administration), and an open source consortium. This industry-near research addresses concrete, business-oriented objectives. All solutions are open source and developed as microservices to facilitate exploitation, with a target at TRL 6.

 \item Software engineering faces new challenges with the advent of modern software-intensive systems such as complex critical embedded systems, cyber-physical systems and the Internet of things. Application domains range from robotics, transportation systems, defense to home automation, smart cities, and energy management, among others. Software is more and more pervasive, integrated into large and distributed systems, and dynamically adaptable in response to a complex and open environment. As a major consequence, the engineering of such systems involves multiple stakeholders, each with some form of domain-specific knowledge, and with an increasingly use of software as an integration layer.

Hence more and more organizations are adopting Domain Specific Languages (DSLs) to allow domain experts to express solutions directly in terms of relevant domain concepts. This new trend raises new challenges about designing DSLs, evolving a set of DSLs and coordinating the use of multiple DSLs for both DSL designers and DSL users.

ALE will contribute to the field of Software Language Engineering, aiming to provide more agility to both language designers and language users. The main objective is twofold. First, we aim to help language designers to leverage previous DSL implementation efforts by reusing and combining existing language modules. Second, we aim to provide more flexibility to  language users by ensuring interoperability between different DSLs and offering live feedback about how the model or program behaves while it is being edited (aka. live programming/modeling).

The GEMOC studio has been sustained through the creation of a Research Consortium at the Eclipse Foundation.

\subsubsection{International initiative GEMOC}
The GEMOC initiative (cf. \url{http://www.gemoc.org}) is an open and international initiative launched in 2013 that coordinate research partners worldwide to develop breakthrough software language engineering (SLE) approaches that support global software engineering through the use of multiple domain-specific languages. GEMOC members aim to provide effective SLE solutions to problems associated with the design and implementation of collaborative, interoperable and composable modeling languages.

The GEMOC initiative aims to provide a framework that facilitates collaborative work on the challenges of using of multiple domain-specific languages in software development projects. The framework consists of mechanisms for coordinating the work of members, and for disseminating research results and other related information on GEMOC activities. The framework also provides the required infrastructure for sharing artifacts produced by members, including publications, case studies, and tools.

The governance of the GEMOC initiative is ensured by the Advisory Board. The role of the Advisory Board is to coordinate the GEMOC work and to ensure proper dissemination of work products and information about GEMOC events (e.g., meetings, workshops).

Benoit Combemale is the co-founder and currently acts as principal coordinator of the GEMOC initiative. Benoit Combemale and Jean-Marc Jézéquel are part of the Advisory Board, and 9 DIVERSE members are part of the GEMOC initiative.
